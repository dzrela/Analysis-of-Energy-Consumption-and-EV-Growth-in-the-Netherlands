# Summary

Utilizing a dataset on [Energy Consumption in the Netherlands](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucabasa/dutch-energy/data), together with Government data on [Electric Vehicle Statistics in the Netherlands](https://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2022-07/Statistics-electric-vehicles-and-charging-in-the-%20Netherlands-up-to-and-including-June-2022.pdf), I have developed this project to analyze whether there is a correlation regarding EV sales over time, with changes in the energy that is delivered back to the grid.

# Background

Through time, studies have indicated a correlation between owning an EV and installing Solar Photovoltaics [PV's] at one's home. [(Hajhashemi et al. 2024,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11043074/)[ Lyu (2023)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jaerec/doi10.1086-723494.html) A survey conducted in 2018 in the SF Bay Area suggested EV owners have a higher likelihood of adopting PV's, and conversely, home owners with PV's are also more likely to purchase an Electric Vehicle, although this correlation is less strong that the former [(Sharda et al. 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.114172). As the worldwide share of EV's surges, causing additional electricity demand, so does high charging power demand in households [(Jochem et al. 2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285748828_How_to_Integrate_Electric_Vehicles_in_the_Future_Energy_System).

23% of all electric car charging points across the EU are located in the Netherlands, who has a 30.8% market share of all EV's sold in the continent. [(Acea.auto)](https://www.acea.auto/figure/interactive-map-correlation-between-electric-car-sales-and-charging-point-availability-2023-data/#:~:text=Key%20findings,of%20the%20region's%20surface%20area.), highlighting the Dutch market's global dominance in terms of EV adoption.

Surplus power that is fed back to the grid is often generated due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources. Among renewable energy sources, solar energy has the greatest impact on increasing the amount of surplus electricity. [(Rad et al. 2023, )](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148123006961)[ Kaschub et al.

# Objective

Given the information provided in the previous section, I will analyze a dataset on energy consumption in the Netherlands, comparing it to governmental data on EV statistics also in the Netherlands, in order to provide a visualization for relevant information on these topics, as well as pointing out if there is a significant trend in terms of the energy that is fed back to the grid, and the vehicle sales over time.

This project consists of the following stages:

  1. Obtaining relevant data for the project (2 datasets)
  2. Cleansing and querying the data (.csv files)
  3. Extracting queried data into Tableau for data visualization
  4. Developing a dashboard on Tableau
  5. Gathering additional background information for this Github portfolio
